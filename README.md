# Jenkins Project

This repository contains a Jenkins pipeline script that automates various stages of a deployment process for a project. The pipeline fetches code from a GitLab repository, builds a Docker image, runs tests, pushes the image to Docker Hub, and deploys the image to a remote server.

## Pipeline Overview

The pipeline is designed to automate the deployment process for your project. It follows these main stages:

1. **Fetch Files**: This stage checks out the code from the specified GitLab repository.

2. **Build and Test**: In this stage, the pipeline builds a Docker image, runs tests on the code, and ensures its functionality.

3. **Login**: This stage authenticates with Docker Hub using provided credentials.

4. **Push**: The pipeline pushes the Docker image to your Docker Hub repository.

5. **Deployment**: This stage involves deploying the Docker image to a remote server.

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have Jenkins set up with the required plugins and agents.

2. Update the pipeline script with your specific details, such as GitLab repository URL, Docker Hub credentials, and deployment server information.

3. Configure Jenkins to trigger the pipeline based on your desired events (e.g., code push).

4. Run the pipeline and observe the automated deployment process in action.

## Pipeline Details

The pipeline script is written in Groovy and defines the different stages and steps of the deployment process:

- **Fetch Files**: The code is fetched from the GitLab repository.

- **Build and Test**: The Docker image is built, tests are executed, and the container is run for testing purposes.

- **Login**: Docker Hub credentials are used for authentication.

- **Push**: The Docker image is pushed to Docker Hub.

- **Deployment**: The Docker image is deployed to a remote server using SSH.

## Notes

- This pipeline script is a starting point and should be customized to match your specific project requirements.

- Ensure you have the necessary credentials (e.g., Docker Hub credentials, deployment SSH keys) set up in your Jenkins environment.

- Review the script carefully to understand each stage's actions and modify them as needed.

- Be cautious when deploying to remote servers and ensure you're following security best practices.
